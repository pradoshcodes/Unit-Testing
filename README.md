Unit Testing
Welcome to my GitHub profile! This repository is dedicated to showcasing my work and knowledge in unit testing.

What is Unit Testing?
Unit testing is a crucial aspect of software development where individual parts of a program, known as units, are tested to ensure they function correctly in isolation. These units are typically functions, methods, or classes.

Why Unit Testing?
Unit testing helps identify and fix bugs early in the development process, ensuring that each unit of code performs as expected. It also provides a safety net for refactoring and making changes to the codebase, as any regressions can be quickly caught by running the tests.

Technologies Used
In this repository, you'll find examples of unit tests written in various programming languages, such as:

Java
Python
JavaScript
C#
These tests demonstrate different testing frameworks and methodologies, including JUnit, pytest, Jest, and NUnit.

How to Use
Feel free to explore the code samples and run the tests in your local development environment. Each directory contains a README with instructions on how to set up and run the tests for that particular language.

Contributions
I welcome contributions from the community! If you have any suggestions, improvements, or additional examples you'd like to see, please don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy testing!
